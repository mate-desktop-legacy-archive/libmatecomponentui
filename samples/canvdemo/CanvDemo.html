>&#13;        The Mate Canvas widget provides an abstraction layer between drawing
        objects and a drawing area. Using the Mate Canvas object abstraction
        alone it is possible to build a large scale graphical application with
        minimal coupling between objects.  The MateComponent Canvas Component takes the
        canvas abstraction one step further by allowing individual canvas groups
        or items to be set up as Corba servers. Using the canvas component
        abstraction it is possible to actual break up the job of rendering to
        canvas into separate programs such that the only coupling between the
        programs is at the IDL level.

>&#13;        This is a simple demonstration program to show how MateComponent Canvas
        Components can be used. A circle process and a square process are
        factory servers of canvas items to a client main program canvas. The
        demonstration shows how the item can be updated from the client side via
        click and drag or from the server side via a periodic update loop. In a
        more extreme case it shows how one server can be used to simultaneously
        update the canvas items on multiple clients.

>&#13;      The square program simply adds a Mate Canvas Rectangle item to the
      canvas. It sets up signal handler for drag and drop events and sets up a
      timeout for moving on its own.  A push button is used to start and
      stop the timeout, and a spin button is used to change the timeout speed.

>&#13;      There are two main programs. If you comment the #define WITH_MATECOMPONENT
      preprocessing command, the program will build as a Mate Canvas
      demonstration; otherwise, it builds a MateComponent Canvas Component program.
      The Mate Canvas version creates a top level window with a canvas and the
      control components then adds the square canvas item to it.  The primary
      difference with the MateComponent version is that because it is a server, it must
      be able to handle requests from multiple clients.  It is up to the
      implementer whether it can refuse to serve more than one client or it can
      serve all requesting clients.

      </P
><P
>&#13;      The ObjectData structure has all information needed keep track of the
      square: where it is on the canvas, how fast it is moving, is it being
      dragged, etc. In the non-MateComponent program, a single instance of the
      ObjectData structure is declared at the top of the main program.  In the
      MateComponent version, a GSList linked list is declared at the top of the main
      program.  The linked list is used to keep track of multiple squares that
      could be served to multiple requestors. (Note, this program leaks objects
      and memory when clients disconnect. Sorry.)

>&#13;      The circle server program is almost exactly the same as the square server.
      Aside from the obvious difference that is serves an ellipse item instead
      of a rectangle item, it does something different with its linked list.
      Rather than having a linked list of ObjectData structures, the circle
      server has a single CommonData structure.   The CommonData structure has a
      linked list of ObjectData structures that contain the served canvas items
      and widget references to the canvas items controls.

>&#13;      To see it in action, make sure you build square.c with the #define
      WITH_MATECOMPONENT directive in place.  If you don't want to install the
      CanvDemo.server oaf file, just run the ./square and ./circle from a
      terminal.  From another terminal run 1 or more copies of the main program
      ./main&#38;.  Press the stop button for the circle.  You'll see all the
      circles stop.  Now click and drag the circle as fast as you can. Try
      increasing the speed to 1000 for all the controls.  A speed of 1000
      translates to 100 updates per second per canvas item.  You shouldn't have
      any trouble driving your CPU usage up to 100%.

>&#13;      Ok this looks kind of cool, but what use is it? I'm still trying to figure
      this out myself. Here's my situation:  I have to maintain a 30,000 line
      program that has to plot lots of information from various obscure data
      sources. Not only is the job of getting the data non-trivial, but
      converting the data into some form for which it can be plotted is also
      complex. I suspect that breaking the program down by data source into a
      bunch of smaller programs may simplify maintenance and may make it easier
      for inexperienced programmers to navigate through the code.

>&#13;      I recently spent some time debugging some of the this code so I figure
      this is a good time to document what I have learned.  The canvas component
      code is not yet perfect (if you can believe it.) This documentation only
      describes the parts of the logic that gave me the most trouble. Hopefully
      by writing this, I'll give the next person who needs to debug it a little
      bit of a head start.

>&#13;      To really understand how this interface works knowledge of how the Mate
      Canvas is required first.  I don't yet have this knowledge, but I can
      suggest some places to start: <A
HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/books/WGA/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>      http://developer.gnome.org/doc/books/WGA/index.html</A
>, <A
HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/GGAD/ggad.html"
TARGET="_top"
>      http://developer.gnome.org/doc/GGAD/ggad.html</A
>, and of course the
      mate-canvas.c source code itself.

      </P
><P
>&#13;      By far the most complex part of the interface is the request and do update
      logic.  The Mate Canvas conserves processing by separating its
      calculation task from it graphics rendering task as the graphics rendering
      tends to be repeated more often due to expose events. In the do_update
      calculation task the sorted vector path is determined.  In the draw task
      the graphics are sent to the screen. As a result of user interaction or a
      change at its data source, the canvas item may make an update request at
      anytime. When the request is made, a flag is set in the canvas item and
      the canvas sets up an idle callback.  During the idle callback the canvas
      runs the do_update routine. During the do_update the canvas is
      manipulating the NEED_UPDATE flags on its item tree and it cannot allow
      any item to change its NEED_UPDATE status while it is in this loop.

      </P
><P
>&#13;      For the non-MateComponent case, items are prevented from requesting updates by
      calling GDK_THREADS_ENTER().  This invokes a semaphore locking scheme. For
      a single process, multi-threaded program this works fine. In the MateComponent
      case, there are two or more processes communicating, so even if
      each process is single threaded, the application as a whole will behave as
      if it is multi-threaded and the GDK thread support will not work because
      GDK has no knowledge about other processes that are communicating through
      MateComponent.

      </P
><P
>&#13;      In the MateComponent canvas component model, there are two entry points that can
      inititiate a canvas item update request.  The component side may change a
      property of its canvas item due to a change in a database or some other
      data representation.  The container side may request an update due to an
      expose or resize event. In either case the communication flow is roughly
      the same.

      </P
><P
>&#13;      The flow diagram for an update requested by the component is shown in the
      diagram below.  When the component changes a property, a NEED_UPDATE flag
      is set internal to the canvas item.  Sometime later the component's
      component canvas idle_handler is called.  The initiates the rih_update.

      </P
><P
>&#13;      The rih_update from the component sets up another idle callback for the
      canvas item in the container. When the container's idle handler is
      invoked, invoke_update is finally called on the component side and the
      component item is updated.

      </P
><P
>&#13;      When the update is requested from the conatainer side there is less
      processing.  The flow starts out on the right in the diagram above.  Once
      invoke_update is called at the component side, this is the end of the
      update.

      </P
><P
>&#13;      The logic can break down if both the container and component request an
      update at approximately the same time. Lets say the container makes an
      update request on one if its canvas components.  It would set up an
      idle_handler and proceed to call do_update from within the idle_handler.
      Just before do_update gets called on the container side, the component
      makes a request_update call. Next the container starts to process
      do_update. From somewhere within the do_update procedure, the container
      calls MateComponent_Canvas_Component_update on the component side.  At this time
      the component processes the update call, but also requires that the
      container process the components request_update. But, the container cannot
      process the component's request_update without corrupting its NEED_UPDATE
      flags. One answer to this problem (the one implemented presently) is to
      have the container set up its own idle callback to process the component's
      update request as soon as it finishes with its do_update.

      </P
><P
>
      For a case where there are multiple components and multiple containers
      where a change to one component may effect all others the problem gets
      even more interesting.  In the circle.c example program changing one
      circle component at the server causes all other circle components to
      change. Here we have a case where an event signal from one component might
      trigger a request_update for a component that is a member of a different
      canvas.  This case is described below:

        I suspect this has to happen because if event() had actually come from 2
        then the processes would otherwise be in a deadlock. Of course the Corba
        ORB doesn't necessarily know what would cause a deadlock and what
        wouldn't.

        What would happen if process 1 called 2 and waited for a return value.
        When 2 gets called, it needs to call 1 to finish, but 1 is busy waiting

      where MateComponent_Canvas_ComponentProxy_requestUpdate is called.  For the

>&#13;      Possible ramifications of dropping return value for emit_event: If
      container has the component attached to a group created on the container
      side and the component needs to decide whether it or its container should
      handle the event for its canvas item, there may be cases where the results
      will not get there.  If someone is trying to do this, it is probably an
      unhealthy coupling anyway.  The interface will not guarantee the correct
      return value sent by the component. For someone to be doing this, they
      would have a very tight coupling case.  I suspect they would have much
      bigger problems then this return value.
